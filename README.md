# freeCodeCamp-JS-algorithmChallenges

As I work through the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course, I thought it might be fun to post my solutions to the challenges here.
The course is found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/
It is free (as the name suggests) and has been very helpful for me learning JavaScript so far.
